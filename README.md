# CSCE 489 - Final Project

A simple visualization for my group's (Alex Lee, Andy Hurley, April Ford, Sarah Moudy, and myself) final project.
Consists of three colored snake-like objects that randomly wander a hexagonal grid, illuminated by a single
moveable light source.

Currently, the light source is bound to the mouse, but that can be changed rather easily.

## Dependencies

- [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org/)
- OpenGL 2.0+ compatible driver (for the lighting effect)
